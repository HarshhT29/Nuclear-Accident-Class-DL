## Implementation Example: LSTM Model with Attention

Below is a pseudocode example of implementing an LSTM model with attention in Python using TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Dropout, Attention, Concatenate

def build_lstm_attention_model(n_features, seq_length, n_classes):
    # Input layer
    inputs = Input(shape=(seq_length, n_features))
    
    # LSTM layers
    lstm_out = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
    lstm_out = Dropout(0.3)(lstm_out)
    lstm_out2 = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(lstm_out)
    
    # Attention mechanism
    attention = Attention()([lstm_out2, lstm_out2])
    
    # Global context vector
    attention_flat = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(attention)
    
    # Output layers
    x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(attention_flat)
    x = Dropout(0.3)(x)
    outputs = Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
    
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    
    # Compile model
    model.compile(
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
        loss='categorical_crossentropy',
        metrics=['accuracy']
    )
    
    return model

# Training pipeline
def train_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
    # Early stopping
    early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
        monitor='val_loss', 
        patience=10,
        restore_best_weights=True
    )
    
    # Learning rate schedule
    lr_scheduler = tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(
        monitor='val_loss',
        factor=0.5,
        patience=5,
        min_lr=1e-6
    )
    
    # Model checkpoint
    checkpoint = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        'best_model.h5',
